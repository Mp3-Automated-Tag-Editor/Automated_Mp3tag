Abstract - The Music space int today’s world is ever
evolving and expanding. With great improvements to
today’s technology, we have been able to bring out music
to the vast majority of today’s ever growing and tech
savvy people. In today’s market, the biggest players for
Music Streaming include behemoth corporations like
Spotify, Gaana, Apple Music, YouTube Music and so on
and so forth. This also happens to be quite the shift from
how music was once listened to. For songs downloaded out
of Old Music Databases, and other distribution sites, they
oftentimes come without any known metadata. i.e., Most
of the Details with regards to the songs are absent, such as
the Artist’s name, the year it was made, Album Art, etc.
This piece of software aims to tackle this problem via the
principles of data mining and data aggregation via
classification-based algorithms.

Proposed Solution: Proposed solution is to deploy an
automation software that can data mine (data scrape)
required metadata from various sources like google
searches, Wikipedia, Spotify Databases, etc. This
metadata is then applied to the required songs along with
appropriate cover art. The Pert Diagram shown above
best describes the thought process behind the given
Project.
